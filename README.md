# haven

## Inspiration
There are many activities university students experience, such as learning, networking, and social events. Sometimes, these activities can lead to intoxicated nights. Students tend to overestimate how much substances they can handle, putting them in dangerous situations. One common, yet very dangerous issue is people wandering from the rest of their group. 

## What it does
With Haven, the wanderer can keep track of their location, set a boundary, and assign a friendâ€™s number for their phone to text if they were to leave the boundary. Setting the boundary will help keep the user within a safe area, as the user will receive a notification themselves if they leave the boundary, and after 2 minutes, the number assigned will get a text with your current location, notifying them of the friend's wandering. This will prevent the user from wandering too far which could lead to many dangerous situations. 

## How we built it
We built Haven using React Native and employed the React Native Maps and React Navigation libraries as well as Radar and Google Maps APIs. The primary language used was JavaScript, although we used Java as well.

## Challenges we ran into
With no prior knowledge with React Native, mobile app development, and limited javascript and APIs usage, the entire development process was a challenging experience. We also spent over 12h setting up our tech environment, switching from Android Studio to React Native with Expo, then to pure React Native, leaving us with much less time to create the final product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we managed to overcome our technical issues and create a mobile application with zero experience in mobile development. We're also proud that every team member was able to learn something new, from React Native for mobile development to Figma for design.

## What we learned
The development team gained experience with React Native and the usage of APIs with it, while the business member experimented with design and the tool, Figma. We also learned to ideate and prototype quickly to create a product within 24h. Together, we learned the importance of planning and debugging to develop the final product, Haven.

## What's next for Haven
In the future, we plan on incorporating all of our desired features in order to make a fully functional app that can be deployed on the Google Play Store. We would like to incorporate user-logins so that friends can be directly notified via Haven if their friends wander out of their boundaries, and would like to flesh out current features even more.
